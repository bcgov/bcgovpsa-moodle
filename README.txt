# BC Government Public Service Agency Moodle

This child theme is for BC Gov Public Service Agency customizations.

The intent here is to provide some alterations to the default 
templates in as *minimal* fashion as possible. The more templates
we override, the more custom functionality we add, the more we 
open ourselves to maintainance problems in the future.

To start with, we are:

* Overriding the navbar templates to replace some classes so that we can color it BC Gov colors
* Overriding the default login page templates to provide a FAQ and links to documentation to assist with SSO support issues
